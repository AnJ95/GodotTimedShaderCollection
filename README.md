# Godo Timed Shader Collection

**Currently work in progress! Detailed README coming soon, I promise.**

## Main idea
2D shaders can add a finishing touch to any 2D game. Sometimes it's hard to test the effects with many uniforms - especially if there is a time dependency.

This project offers a UI to customize a time-dependant intensity value using godot tweening/easing which is exported to a **shader-friendly intensity texture**.

Additionally, there are a handful of example shaders that make use of the intensity texture. Add your own shaders, customize the uniforms and export the complete ShaderMaterial in one click to use in your project!
